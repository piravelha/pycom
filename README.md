# What is PyCom?

PyCom is currently a W.I.P python library that is aiming to be a simple compiler backend for small languages.

PyCom allows you to define a lexer, parser, and transform your AST into a simplified C AST, it comes with a builtin code generation tool for the C AST, so you can compile your AST into C indirectly using the transformer to C AST.
